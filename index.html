		My research focuses on Trustworthy AI, Mobile Computing, and Cybersecurity.
		I apply AI/ML to explore the use of ubiquitous modalities, such as WiFi signals, cameras, and acoustics, for developing novelty applications to protect human personal sensitive data and secure the operations of AI systems.  
		I collaborate with professionals across diverse domains, such as Civil Engineering, Sociology, Health, and Data Science. 
		I earned my PhD degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in 2023. During my PhD study, I had worked in the <a href="https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/wisn/">Wolfpack Interactive, Sensing, and Networking Lab</a>  
	        with <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~mshahza/">Prof. Muhammad Shahzad</a>. I was a member of <a href="https://wspr.csc.ncsu.edu/people.html"> Wolfpack Security and Privacy Research Lab </a> 
under guidance from <a href="https://anupamdas.org/">Prof. Anupam Das</a>. I currently lead the <a href="https://zhangshaohu.github.io/XPluses/">X+ Lab</a>. 
		I teach undergraduate students programming, software engineering, and cybersecurity courses at UNCP. </p>
